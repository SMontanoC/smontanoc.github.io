    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We study how signaling skills that are specific to college majors affect labor market outcomes of college graduates. We rely on census-like data and a regression discontinuity design to study the impacts of a well-known award given to top performers on a mandatory nationwide exam in Colombia. The award allows students to signal their high level of specific skills when searching for a job. These students earn 7 to 12 percent more than otherwise identical students lacking the signal. This positive return persists five years after graduation. The signal mostly benefits workers who graduate from low-reputation colleges, and allows workers to find jobs in more productive firms and in sectors that better use their skills. We rule out that the positive earnings returns are explained by human capital. The signal favors mostly less advantaged groups, implying that reducing information frictions about students' skills could potentially shrink earnings gaps. Our results imply that information policies like those that formally certify skills can improve the efficiency in talent allocation of the economy and, at the same time, level the playing field. </p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Teacher quality is a key factor in improving student academic achievement. As such, education policymakers are incentivized to design screening systems to hire the most effective teachers. In this paper, we study the effects of introducing a merit-based screening system for all Colombian public schools that ties teacher hiring decisions to candidates' performance on an exam evaluating subject-specific knowledge and teaching aptitude. This policy had the intended result of increasing the pre-college test scores of teachers by 17 percentile points. However, it also unintentionally increased the number of novice teachers and decreased the overall stock of teacher experience. Using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares the outcomes of students from public and private schools over two decades, we find that instead of improving student outcomes, this screening system decreased students' performance on high school exit exams by 8 percent of a standard deviation, and reduced the likelihood of enrolling and graduating from college by over 10 percent. These results suggest that using ex-ante teacher quality measures to screen teacher candidates may have a limited effect and can even result in negative selection of teacher characteristics important for students' achievement.</p></div><br>

    <p style="margin:0"> <b>Flexibility and College Success: Evidence from a Reform at a Flagship University</b> <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> College completion rates across countries remain low despite governmental efforts. Success in college depends on students' preparation and financial constraints, but it also depends on college quality and other supply-side factors. In this paper, I use a difference-in-differences strategy to show that increasing the flexibility of academic activities at a selective university in Colombia negatively affected students' educational attainment. Specifically, students' probability of graduating within six years decreased by ten percentage points (32 percent), and dropout rates within 2 years increased by four percentage points (or 11 percent). Initial evidence suggests that these effects are driven by strong incentives faced by students to complete fewer classes per semester post-reform implementation.</p></div><br>
